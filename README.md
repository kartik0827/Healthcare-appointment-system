## Project Overview

The Healthcare Appointment System provides a simple interface for patients to book appointments with doctors and for administrators to manage doctors, schedules, and appointments. It includes **Lingo CLI-powered multilingual support**, enabling automatic and developer-friendly translation of the entire application.

The Healthcare Appointment System provides a simple interface for patients to book appointments with doctors and for administrators to manage doctors, schedules, and appointments. It is suitable as a teaching project and can be extended into a production-ready system.

This README assumes the repository contains a typical web app structure (frontend, backend, DB config). If your repo differs, update the paths and commands accordingly.

## Features

* **Multilingual Support using Lingo CLI** — easily translate UI content into multiple languages with AI-powered localization

* Patient registration and profile management

* Doctor listing and profile (specialties, availability)

* Appointment booking, rescheduling, and cancellation

* Admin dashboard to manage doctors, patients and appointments

* Notifications/confirmation (email/SMS) — optional integration

* Role-based access (admin, doctor, patient)

## Tech Stack

* **Localization:** Lingo CLI for seamless multilingual integration (see the **Multilingual support** section below for setup and examples)

> Update this section with the exact tech used in your repo. Below is a common stack for such a project.

* **Localization:** Lingo CLI for seamless multilingual integration

> Update this section with the exact tech used in your repo. Below is a common stack for such a project.

* **Frontend:** React / Next.js / Vue (adjust as necessary)
* **Backend:** Node.js (Express) / Django / Flask / Spring Boot
* **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL
* **Authentication:** JWT / Passport / OAuth

* **Dev Tools:** Docker, VS Code, Git

## Multilingual support (Lingo CLI)

This project integrates **Lingo.dev's CLI** to provide AI-powered localization and a developer-friendly workflow for maintaining translations. The Lingo CLI treats your project as the source of truth, automatically discovers translation strings, and can generate and sync locale files for target languages.

### Why use Lingo CLI

* Auto-translates UI and content with AI while preserving context and existing structure.
* Fingerprints strings and caches results so only changed text is re-translated.
* Works with many file formats (JSON, YAML, Android XML, etc.) and supports BCP-47 locale codes.
* Integrates with CI/CD to keep translations up to date automatically.

### Quick setup (recommended)

1. Install & authenticate:

```bash
# run via npx so no global install required
npx lingo.dev@latest auth --login
```

2. Initialize Lingo in your project (example: target French and Spanish):

```bash
npx lingo.dev@latest init --targets fr es --bucket json
```

This will create an `i18n.json` configuration file and scaffold locale files under your chosen path.

3. Generate (or update) translations from your source locale file:

```bash
npx lingo.dev@latest i18n
# or run the CLI "run" command which will scan and translate
npx lingo.dev@latest run
```

### Example `i18n.json` (created by `init`)

```json
{
  "locale": {
    "source": "en",
    "targets": ["fr", "es"]
  },
  "buckets": [
    {
      "type": "json",
      "include": ["frontend/src/locales/*.json"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example project layout for translations

```
frontend/
├─ src/
│  ├─ locales/
│  │  ├─ en.json        # source strings (single source-of-truth file is recommended)
│  │  ├─ fr.json        # auto-generated by Lingo
│  │  └─ es.json        # auto-generated by Lingo
```

### Recommended npm scripts

Add these to your `package.json` to simplify usage:

```json
"scripts": {
  "lingo:init": "npx lingo.dev@latest init",
  "lingo:auth": "npx lingo.dev@latest auth --login",
  "lingo:pull": "npx lingo.dev@latest i18n",
  "lingo:run": "npx lingo.dev@latest run"
}
```

### CI integration

Use Lingo's CI command or GitHub Action to automatically commit translations to a branch or create PRs. Example (GitHub Action snippet):

```yaml
- name: Install Lingo CLI
  run: npm install -g @lingo/cli
- name: Pull translations
  env:
    LINGO_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LINGO_API_KEY }}
  run: lingo pull --api-key=${{ secrets.LINGO_API_KEY }}
```

(You can also use `lingo dev ci` to create commits/PRs automatically.)

### Integration notes (React / Next.js)

* Keep a single source file (e.g. `en.json`) and let Lingo generate target locale files.
* If using runtime i18n libs (i18next, next-translate, next-i18next), point them at the generated files under `src/locales`.
* For build-time localization, consider Lingo's compiler or bundler plugins that localize without changing source code.

### Best practices

* Review AI translations for domain-specific terms (medical terminology) and add glossary entries if needed.
* Add Lingo authentication to CI as a secret and automate `lingo pull` to keep translations in sync.
* Exclude sensitive files and large binary assets from Lingo discovery using `include`/`exclude` patterns in `i18n.json`.

## Folder Structure (example)

```
Healthcare-appointment-system/
├─ backend/                # API server (Express/Django/etc.)
│  ├─ src/
│  ├─ routes/
│  ├─ controllers/
│  ├─ models/
│  ├─ config/
│  └─ package.json
├─ frontend/               # React / Next frontend
│  ├─ src/
│  ├─ pages/
│  ├─ components/
│  └─ package.json
├─ docs/                   # design docs, ER diagrams, Postman collections
├─ docker/                 # docker-compose, Dockerfiles
└─ README.md
```

## Installation (Local Development)

> The commands below are a guideline. Replace them with the actual commands in your repo.

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kartik0827/Healthcare-appointment-system.git
cd Healthcare-appointment-system
```

2. Install backend dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install    # or `pip install -r requirements.txt` for Python
```

3. Install frontend dependencies (in a new terminal)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder (and `frontend` if necessary). Example variables:

```
# backend/.env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/healthcare
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=supersecret
```

Adjust for PostgreSQL or MySQL if used.

## Running the App

### Option A — Run locally with separate servers

Start the backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev   # or `python manage.py runserver` or `flask run`
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` (or the port your frontend uses).

### Option B — With Docker

If the repo contains a `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start the required services (app, db) and expose ports as configured.

## API Endpoints (Examples)

> Update these to match your actual API routes.

```
POST /api/auth/register        # Register a patient
POST /api/auth/login           # Login -> returns JWT
GET  /api/doctors              # List all doctors
GET  /api/doctors/:id          # Doctor profile
POST /api/appointments         # Book new appointment (patient)
GET  /api/appointments         # List appointments (role-based)
PATCH /api/appointments/:id    # Reschedule / update
DELETE /api/appointments/:id   # Cancel
```

## Testing

* Unit tests: `cd backend && npm test` (or `pytest`)
* Frontend tests: `cd frontend && npm test`

If you use Postman, add the Postman collection to `docs/` and refer to it here.

## Deployment

A few deployment options:

* **VPS / DigitalOcean:** Build and run using PM2 / systemd, reverse proxy with Nginx
* **Platform-as-a-Service:** Vercel for frontend + Heroku/GCP/AWS for backend
* **Docker:** Push images to Docker Hub and run in cloud (AWS ECS / GCP Cloud Run)

Add a `Procfile` or platform-specific configs if deploying to Heroku or Render.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Suggested steps:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
3. Commit your changes and push
4. Open a Pull Request with a clear description and screenshots if relevant
